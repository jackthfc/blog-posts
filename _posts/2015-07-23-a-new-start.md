## A new start

I've moved my website to Github pages and I'm now using the static-site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Sorry about the mess. I've stripped the site of styling and content to force me to redesign the site iteratively overtime. Apart from some old blog posts (that I will eventually migrate over) there wasn't much to see on my old site anyway. My design portfolio isn't on a public facing domain. Maybe I will change that in the future.

I'm really excited by Jekyll. It feels good to be liberated from third party systems and take control of my code again. To get to this point I've used a combination of Anna Debenham's 24 ways article '[Getting started with Github pages](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages)' and Barry Clark's '[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)' starter repo. The Web Ahead podcast also has a good [introductory episode on Jekyll](http://5by5.tv/webahead/54). I'm looking forward to finding out more.
